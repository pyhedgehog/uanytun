Notes: 
  - try './configure --help' for further information
  - if using openssl pre 0.9.8 you have to disable passphrase
    because openssl had no SHA256 implementation prior to this
    version
  - on OpenBSD you have to use gmake instead of make
  - currently there is no support for using IPv6 as
    outer Protocol on OpenBSD because it does not support
    V4-Mapped adresses
