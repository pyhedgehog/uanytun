Dependencies
============

uAnytun can be built by using either libgcrypt or the openssl-crypto library. 
The latter is more performant in most cases but there are some license 
issues when using this library. It also needs more space when installed.

Linux
-----

using libgcrypt:
 
 build-essential
 libgcrypt11-dev

using ssl crypto library:

 build-essential
 libssl-dev


OpenBSD
-------

using libgcrypt:

 gmake
 libgcrypt
 libgpg-error

using ssl crypto library:

 gmake


Installation
============

Getting the source via subversion:
----------------------------------
svn co https://svn.chaos-at-home.org/uanytun/trunk uanytun

Building from source
--------------------

using libgcrypt:

# cd src
# ./configure
# make

using ssl crypto library:

# cd src
# ./configure --use-ssl-crypto
# make


Notes: 
  - try './configure --help' for further information
  - if using openssl pre 0.9.8 you have to disable passphrase
    because openssl had no SHA256 implementation prior to this
    version
  - on OpenBSD you have to use gmake instead of make
