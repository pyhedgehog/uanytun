.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBuAnytun\fR is a tiny implementation of the Secure Anycast Tunneling Protocol (SATP)\&. It provides a complete VPN solution similar to OpenVPN or IPsec in tunnel mode\&. The main difference is that anycast enables the setup of tunnels between an arbitrary combination of anycast, unicast and multicast hosts\&. Unlike Anytun which is a full featured implementation uAnytun has no support for multiple connections or synchronisation\&. It is a small single threaded implementation intended to act as a client on small platforms\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fBuAnytun\fR has been designed as a peer to peer application, so there is no difference between client and server\&. The following options can be passed to the daemon:
.PP
\fB\-D, \-\-nodaemonize\fR
.RS 4
This option instructs
\fBuAnytun\fR
to run in foreground instead of becoming a daemon which is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-u, \-\-username \fR\fB\fI<username>\fR\fR
.RS 4
run as this user\&. If no group is specified (\fB\-g\fR) the default group of the user is used\&. The default is to not drop privileges\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-g, \-\-groupname \fR\fB\fI<groupname>\fR\fR
.RS 4
run as this group\&. If no username is specified (\fB\-u\fR) this gets ignored\&. The default is to not drop privileges\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-C, \-\-chroot \fR\fB\fI<path>\fR\fR
.RS 4
Instruct
\fBuAnytun\fR
to run in a chroot jail\&. The default is to not run in chroot\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-P, \-\-write\-pid <filename>\fR
.RS 4
Instruct
\fBuAnytun\fR
to write it\(cqs pid to this file\&. The default is to not create a pid file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-L, \-\-log \fR\fB\fI<target>:<level>[,<param1>[,<param2>[\&.\&.]]]\fR\fR
.RS 4
add log target to logging system\&. This can be invoked several times in order to log to different targets at the same time\&. Every target has its own log level which is a number between 0 and 5\&. Where 0 means disabling log and 5 means debug messages are enabled\&.

The file target can be used more than once with different levels\&. If no target is provided at the command line a single target with the config
\fIsyslog:3,uanytun,daemon\fR
is added\&.

The following targets are supported:
.PP
\fIsyslog\fR
.RS 4
log to syslog daemon, parameters <level>[,<logname>[,<facility>]]
.RE
.PP
\fIfile\fR
.RS 4
log to file, parameters <level>[,<path>]
.RE
.PP
\fIstdout\fR
.RS 4
log to standard output, parameters <level>
.RE
.PP
\fIstderr\fR
.RS 4
log to standard error, parameters <level>
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-U, \-\-debug\fR
.RS 4
This option instructs
\fBuAnytun\fR
to run in debug mode\&. It implicits
\fB\-D\fR
(don\(cqt daemonize) and adds a log target with the configuration
\fIstdout:5\fR
(logging with maximum level)\&. In future releases there might be additional output when this option is supplied\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i, \-\-interface \fR\fB\fI<ip address>\fR\fR
.RS 4
This IP address is used as the sender address for outgoing packets\&. The default is to not use a special inteface and just bind on all interfaces\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p, \-\-port \fR\fB\fI<port>\fR\fR
.RS 4
The local UDP port that is used to send and receive the payload data\&. The two tunnel endpoints can use different ports\&. default: 4444
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r, \-\-remote\-host \fR\fB\fI<hostname|ip>\fR\fR
.RS 4
This option can be used to specify the remote tunnel endpoint\&. In case of anycast tunnel endpoints, the anycast IP address has to be used\&. If you do not specify an address, it is automatically determined after receiving the first data packet\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o, \-\-remote\-port \fR\fB\fI<port>\fR\fR
.RS 4
The UDP port used for payload data by the remote host (specified with \-p on the remote host)\&. If you do not specify a port, it is automatically determined after receiving the first data packet\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-4, \-\-ipv4\-only\fR
.RS 4
Resolv to IPv4 addresses only\&. The default is to resolv both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-6, \-\-ipv6\-only\fR
.RS 4
Resolv to IPv6 addresses only\&. The default is to resolv both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d, \-\-dev \fR\fB\fI<name>\fR\fR
.RS 4
device name

By default, tapN is used for Ethernet tunnel interfaces, and tunN for IP tunnels, respectively\&. This option can be used to manually override these defaults\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t, \-\-type \fR\fB\fI<tun|tap>\fR\fR
.RS 4
device type

Type of the tunnels to create\&. Use tap for Ethernet tunnels, tun for IP tunnels\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n, \-\-ifconfig \fR\fB\fI<local>/<prefix>\fR\fR
.RS 4
The local IP address and prefix length\&. The remote tunnel endpoint has to use a different IP address in the same subnet\&.
.PP
\fI<local>\fR
.RS 4
the local IP address for the tun/tap device
.RE
.PP
\fI<prefix>\fR
.RS 4
the prefix length of the network
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-x, \-\-post\-up\-script \fR\fB\fI<script>\fR\fR
.RS 4
This option instructs
\fBuAnytun\fR
to run this script after the interface is created\&. By default no script will be executed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m, \-\-mux \fR\fB\fI<mux\-id>\fR\fR
.RS 4
the multiplex id to use\&. default: 0
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s, \-\-sender\-id \fR\fB\fI<sender id>\fR\fR
.RS 4
Each anycast tunnel endpoint needs a unique sender id (1, 2, 3, \&...)\&. It is needed to distinguish the senders in case of replay attacks\&. As
\fBuAnytun\fR
does not support synchronisation it can\(cqt be used as an anycast endpoint therefore this option is quite useless but implemented for compatibility reasons\&. default: 0
.RE
.PP
\fB\-w, \-\-window\-size \fR\fB\fI<window size>\fR\fR
.RS 4
seqence window size

Sometimes, packets arrive out of order on the receiver side\&. This option defines the size of a list of received packets\' sequence numbers\&. If, according to this list, a received packet has been previously received or has been transmitted in the past, and is therefore not in the list anymore, this is interpreted as a replay attack and the packet is dropped\&. A value of 0 deactivates this list and, as a consequence, the replay protection employed by filtering packets according to their secuence number\&. By default the sequence window is disabled and therefore a window size of 0 is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-k, \-\-kd\(emprf \fR\fB\fI<kd\-prf type>\fR\fR
.RS 4
key derivation pseudo random function

The pseudo random function which is used for calculating the session keys and session salt\&.

Possible values:
.PP
\fInull\fR

.RE
.PP
\fIaes\-ctr\-128\fR

.RS 4

.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e, \-\-role \fR\fB\fI<role>\fR\fR
.RS 4
SATP uses different session keys for inbound and outbound traffic\&. The role parameter is used to determine which keys to use for outbound or inbound packets\&. On both sides of a vpn connection different roles have to be used\&. Possible values are
\fIleft\fR
and
\fIright\fR\&. You may also use
\fIalice\fR
or
\fIserver\fR
as a replacement for
\fIleft\fR
and
\fIbob\fR
or
\fIclient\fR
as a replacement for
\fIright\fR\&. By default
\fIleft\fR
is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-E, \-\-passphrase \fR\fB\fI<pass phrase>\fR\fR
.RS 4
This passphrase is used to generate the master key and master salt\&. For the master key the last n bits of the SHA256 digest of the passphrase (where n is the length of the master key in bits) is used\&. The master salt gets generated with the SHA1 digest\&. You may force a specific key and or salt by using
\fB\-\-key\fR
and
\fB\-\-salt\fR\&.
